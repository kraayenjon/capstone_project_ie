# Capstone Project MBD IE

# Overview
The Capstone Project seeks to revolutionize SuperCenter, a top-tier supermarket chain renowned for its selection of organic products, by implementing advanced, data-driven recommendation systems. This initiative addresses pressing business challenges and significantly elevates the customer shopping experience.

# Business Challenges and Strategic Goals
SuperCenter struggles with several critical issues, including improving customer satisfaction, streamlining product discovery, and amplifying customer awareness of product variety. The strategic aim is to deploy advanced analytical tools to refine product recommendations and optimize search functionalities, positively influencing customer engagement and retention.

# Solutions and Implementation
The project introduces two innovative solutions utilizing the same technology stack, specifically leveraging generative AI and embeddings for recommendation systems. This two-fold approach means that developing the first solution accelerates and simplifies the development of the second, as both share common preprocessing steps.

## Solution #1 - Semantic Search Engine: 
A semantic search system that improves accuracy and relevance, facilitating a smoother product-finding experience for customers.

## Solution #2 - Customized Product Recommendations: 
A sophisticated engine that offers product suggestions tailored to individual customer data and shopping patterns. These solutions are designed to seamlessly integrate SuperCenterâ€™s digital infrastructure, ensuring operational continuity while maximizing customer interaction.

# Benefits and Impact: 
Adopting these strategic solutions is anticipated to deliver considerable financial rewards:

## Shopping Efficiency: 
Introducing more precise search capabilities and customized recommendations is expected to raise the average number of items per basket by up to 11%.

## Revenue Growth: 
These upgrades are projected to increase the average order value, contributing to an overall revenue uplift of approximately 11%.
