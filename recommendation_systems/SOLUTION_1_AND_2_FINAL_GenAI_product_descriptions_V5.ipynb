Solution #1:** Search Engine Optimization\n","\n","### **Business Problem:**\n","SuperCenter's online store currently relies on a traditional keyword-based search engine, which often fails to understand customers' natural language queries accurately. This results in suboptimal search results, leading to frustration and dissatisfaction among customers, ultimately impacting their overall shopping experience and engagement with the online store.\n","\n","\n","### **Use Case:** Improve Customer Experience and Engagement\n","\n","Implement an embedding-based search engine that understands natural language queries, allowing customers to search for products using conversational language rather than relying on specific keywords.\n","\n","Enhance the online shopping experience for customers across all product catalog by improving search accuracy and relevance.\n","\n","Increased customer satisfaction scores, higher conversion rates, and longer session times on the website, indicating a better user experience. Measure the impact through metrics like customer satisfaction surveys, bounce rates, CTR (click-through-rate) and number of  items per shopping cart.\n","\n","\n","\n","The solution aims to **enhance the search experience on SuperCenter's online store by leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) and embeddings technology.**\n","\n","Here's how it works:\n","\n","1. **Product Description Optimization**: To ensure accurate and relevant search results, we first optimize the product descriptions using Google's generative AI model, Gemini.\n","2. **Embeddings Generation**: Next, we convert the product names and the optimized product descriptions into numerical representations called embeddings. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning and context of the text, enabling us to compare and match them with customer queries more effectively. We use Google's pre-trained text embedding models, which have been trained on vast amounts of data, to generate these embeddings.\n","3. **Similarity Computation**: To ensure the accuracy of the generated product descriptions, we compute the similarity between the embeddings of the product name and the corresponding description. This step helps identify and correct any potential discrepancies between the product name and the generated description, ensuring that the search results are highly relevant.\n","4. **Search Engine Implementation**: The core of the solution is the embedding-based search engine, built using the SCANN (Scalable Clustered and Approximate Nearest Neighbors) library. When a customer enters a query on SuperCenter's website, we convert that query into an embedding using the same pre-trained models. The search engine then compares this query embedding with the embeddings of all the product descriptions and retrieves a ranked list of the most relevant products based on their similarity

normalized using L2 normalization.\n","\n","The ScaNN searcher has the following settings:\n","\n","- It uses the \"dot_product\" distance measure.\n","- It builds a tree data structure with the number of leaves equal to the record_count, and searches all leaves.\n","- It uses a training sample size equal to the record_count.\n","- It applies the asymmetric hashing (AH) technique with a score of 2 and an anisotropic quantization threshold of 0.2.\n","- It reorders the dataset for better performance.\n","\n","\n","\n","**Search Function:**\n","\n","We define a search function, which takes a
